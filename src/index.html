      <p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the other end of the line, Cecilia lay crumpled, shot in the head at age 35 by her drunken ex-boyfriend, who immediately turned the gun on himself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The last call of her life had been the eighth she made to 911 in a span of nine hours.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From the evening of Oct. 9, 2014, to the early morning of Oct. 10, Lam called repeatedly from the South of Market apartment she shared with four roommates, asking for police to protect her from 29-year-old Cedric Young Jr., with whom she was engaged in a volatile breakup.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After many of her calls, officers sought to help, </span><span class="s2">but they failed to take actions that might have kept her alive</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A Chronicle examination of the case &mdash; including interviews with Cecilia&rsquo;s roommates and family, police reports, 911 recordings and court depositions given by police officers and other witnesses &mdash; reveals a series of questionable actions by </span><span class="s2">authorities</span><span class="s1"> that contributed to a breakdown in a system designed to prevent such domestic violence killings, a system that has been a focus in San Francisco for years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The events the night of Cecilia&rsquo;s murder underscore the complexity of intimate violence and the challenges officers face in intervening. In many domestic violence cases, one of the biggest hurdles to overcome is the mindset of the victim, who is caught up in the shame of being abused and is often unwilling to reach out to law enforcement until it is too late.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Cecilia called for help. Help came. The question that remains, three years later, is why it wasn&rsquo;t enough to save her. It&rsquo;s a question her family has pursued, so far unsuccessfully, in court, hoping to force the Police Department to re-evaluate how its officers respond to domestic violence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The Police Department has declined to comment on the case, but department officials say the city has come a long way in creating effective policies for responding to domestic violence calls, and in training officers to recognize when a situation may be more complicated and dangerous than it seems.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">John Cot&eacute;, a spokesman for the city attorney&rsquo;s office, said that while Cecilia&rsquo;s death was a tragedy, &ldquo;Ultimately, the responsibility for Cecilia Lam&rsquo;s death lies with the person who committed this senseless crime.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But like the stubborn, spirited woman they miss every day, the family isn&rsquo;t giving up.</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">&ldquo;I would like, and my family would like, for this not to happen to anyone else,&rdquo; said Eddie Lam, the victim&rsquo;s younger brother. &ldquo;We know bad things happen to good people every day. But I don&rsquo;t want her to be just another number. I want people to understand that this didn&rsquo;t have to happen this way.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The night Cecilia died began like many others </span><span class="s2">had</span><span class="s1"> in the second-floor apartment on the 500 block of Natoma Street in the South of Market neighborhood. At about 7 p.m., Michael Ramirez, one of Cecilia&rsquo;s four roommates, returned home to find her and Young in the kitchen, arguing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their four-year relationship, which had that long been turbulent, had become consumed by Young&rsquo;s alcohol abuse.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;They were constantly fighting,&rdquo; roommate Nikki McKay recalled. &ldquo;You get home and they&rsquo;re fighting. She&rsquo;d come into my room and we&rsquo;d talk about it and it was always just about nonsense. She wanted to hang out with her friends, and he didn&rsquo;t want that. She wanted to go to her parents&rsquo; house, and he would say, &lsquo;Why do you have to go to your parents&rsquo; house all the time?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple had met in 2010, in a chance encounter at a Walgreen&rsquo;s. People were drawn to the vivacious young woman, and Young was no exception. He approached her and struck up a conversation. He was tall, handsome and, at the time, gentle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cecilia called up her childhood best friend, Mario Lieras, to announce: &ldquo;I met a boy!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lieras figured Young was going to be just another fling, but Cecilia had told her mother of a desire to settle down. She wanted a family, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her parents, Joseph and Shut-Fan, had emigrated from Hong Kong more than three decades ago, when Cecilia was 5 and Eddie was 1. Their daughter took on a burden often bestowed upon the eldest children in first-generation American families. She was not only a cultural bridge for her parents, but a mother figure to her younger siblings, making sure they experienced the American norms that were so unfamiliar to their parents.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cecilia was 10 when brother Sunny was born. She called him her &ldquo;baby&rdquo; and her &ldquo;boy.&rdquo; He still jokingly refers to her as his &ldquo;moms.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cecilia had ambitions, </span><span class="s2">but she delayed them in order to put her family first</span><span class="s1">. In 2013, she returned to school after a long absence, pursuing a degree in Asian American studies at San Francisco State University. She hoped to do civil rights work, advocating for women and Asian Americans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;In her spare time,&rdquo; chuckled Lieras, &ldquo;she also wanted to cure cancer. She wanted to be a little power Asian woman and do all the things.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Young, who went by the name Jay, was a San Francisco native who had moved to Chicago as a child after his parents divorced. He grew up with potential, said aunt Victoria Wallace. He was a sweet boy and a nerd at heart, and though he tried to fit in and pretended to be &ldquo;street,&rdquo; he couldn&rsquo;t hide his intelligence, she said. An honor student through high school, he earned a scholarship to Alabama A&amp;M University in Huntsville.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But he dropped out of college following a fight and began running afoul of the law. His father, hoping to straighten him out, brought him back to live in California when he was in his early 20s.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At some point, he turned to drugs and alcohol. He was arrested three times, twice on suspicion of assault and battery, but was never charged because the victims refused to cooperate. He was in an addiction treatment program when he and Cecilia met. But when the two began dating, things clicked, Wallace said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;They were always holding hands, very affectionate,&rdquo; Wallace said. &ldquo;If they were standing, she was right under his arm. You know how you can look at a couple and say, &lsquo;Wow, they are in love!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s how it was.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">But Young&rsquo;s violent tendencies surfaced not long after he moved into Cenilia&rsquo;s Natoma Street apartment .</span><span class="s1"> He got in fights. He punched holes in the walls and broke a door.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Valentine&rsquo;s Day in 2012, Young got drunk and accused his girlfriend of cheating. Two neighbors in the unit below came upstairs when they heard Young tearing up the kitchen. He shoved Lam twice, pushed one of the neighbors and choked the other, according to police reports.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the neighbors took out a restraining order against Young. But when Cecilia reported the incident the next day, she told officers she didn&rsquo;t believe Young had intended to hurt anyone, that she just wanted &ldquo;documentation.&rdquo; None of the victims were willing to cooperate, and although Young was arrested for felony assault and domestic violence, he wasn&rsquo;t charged.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A few weeks before the night of the shooting, McKay, whose room shared a wall with Cecilia&rsquo;s, recalled hearing the couple arguing &mdash; then heard what sounded like choking. Cecilia didn&rsquo;t report any abuse, but soon after, Young was gone from the apartment, and Cecilia told her relieved roommates they had broken up for good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">In early October, though, Lam informed her roommates Young was moving back. She later said he had been homeless following the break-up, and she felt bad for him. </span><span class="s1">Her roommates objected, but on Oct. 9, 2014, there he was.</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A year before Cecilia&rsquo;s death, </span><span class="s2">an outside</span><span class="s1"> (CLARIFY) district attorney&rsquo;s office reviewed San Francisco&rsquo;s domestic violence prosecutions. The inquiry was spurred by allegations (BY WHOM?) that District Attorney George Gasc&oacute;n was not charging enough cases.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The review found that prosecutors couldn&rsquo;t bring charges against some purported abusers because of the way police patrol officers responded to domestic violence calls.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;As a generalization, the patrol level investigations tend to be extremely brief and the burden is transferred to the (police) Inspector to conduct a more detailed investigation,&rdquo; the Riverside report stated.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The city had been working for (HOW MANY?) years to improve its handling of domestic violence cases after </span><span class="s2">the killing of Claire Tempongko. In </span><span class="s1">the 18 months before her death, the 28-year-old had called police, filed reports and sought protective orders, only to be stabbed by an ex-boyfriend in front of her two children </span><span class="s2">on Oct. XX, 2000.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A commission formed after her death found that almost every part of the criminal justice system had failed her, and the city sought to ensure that such a tragedy would not happen again. In some ways, the effort was successful, as city and state agencies collaborated with victim advocates and nonprofit groups. Cecilia&rsquo;s murder was the first domestic violence homicide in the city in four years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, patrol officers receive several days of domestic violence response training at the academy, with a refresher course every two years. The department&rsquo;s Special Victims Unit </span><span class="s2">began </span><span class="s1">a new type of training that </span><span class="s2">allows </span><span class="s1">officers to shadow inspectors in order to better </span><span class="s2">undertand what evidence is needed to support criminal charges.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a believer in if people understand more why they&rsquo;re doing things, they get better at doing it,&rdquo; said Police Capt. Una Bailey, who heads the Special Victims Unit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This past June, the department launched a pilot program out of Bayview Station in which patrol officers responding to domestic violence calls ask victims a specific series of questions to determine the seriousness of each case and put the victims in immediate contact with advocates.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The program may appear commonsense. But for some victims of domestic violence, the psychological effects of the abuse prevents them from realizing the danger they are in until it&rsquo;s too late.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many are like Cecilia: trapped in a seemingly endless cycle of shame, co-dependency, conflicting emotions and violence .</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cecilia, Young and her roommates lived on the second floor of a three-flat building, in an alley that was being transformed with stylish condos . But their 110-year-old building was gray and fading, with a broken iron entry gate that led to a short stairwell and the front doors of the three units.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The middle door opened to a flight of stairs leading up to Cecilia&rsquo;s apartment. On the evening of Oct. 9, she stood at the top of those stairs, yelling down at Young. She&rsquo;d kicked him out again, and was screaming at him to go away.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;I need you to look at this,&rdquo; Cecilia told her roommate Michael Ramirez, </span><span class="s2">s</span><span class="s1">howing him a pot of spaghetti sauce. (NEEDS BETTER ATTRIBUTION SINCE WE WERENT THERE TO SEE THIS) &ldquo;I think Jay may have tried to poison me.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Outside, Young was banging on</span><span class="s2"> the door to their unit</span><span class="s1"> and ringing the bell. At 8:37 p.m., Cecilia made her first call to 911.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;My boyfriend and I, we&rsquo;re pretty much fighting right now and I&rsquo;m asking him to leave my home,&rdquo; she told the dispatcher. &ldquo;And he will not leave ... it&rsquo;s starting to escalate.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Young had been drinking all day, she said, then quickly added, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s actually leaving now.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Want me to send the police?&rdquo; the dispatcher asked.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Cecilia responded. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re OK.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They weren&rsquo;t. She called back at 9:14 p.m. and again at 9:33 p.m., describing an &ldquo;escalating domestic violence issue.&rdquo; Young was back and ringing the doorbell, over and over again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting more scared,&rdquo; Cecilia said in the third call. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s going to break in.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ramirez, the roommate, dialed 911 around the same time, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling to straight up say this guy is insane and he&rsquo;s trying to get inside.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dispatchers flagged the incident as a &ldquo;418 DV,&rdquo; a domestic violence dispute. As Lam made her third call to 911, Officers Adam Lobsinger and Chhungmeng Tov from Southern Station pulled up to the building, arriving about 9:30 p.m. They began talking with Young, who had halted his frenzied attempts to get into the apartment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lobsinger would write in his report that Young </span><span class="s2">seemed calm and</span><span class="s1"> &ldquo;in good spirits.&rdquo; Young told him &ldquo;it was nothing more than couples arguing.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;He had a positive tone to him,&rdquo; Lobsinger recalled in a court deposition. &ldquo;We spoke about our barbecue recipes at a certain point.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As they spoke, Tov later said, Lam came out and defended Young, saying, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good guy. He doesn&rsquo;t cause any trouble. He just gets this way sometimes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Ramirez f</span><span class="s2">elt that despite her attempts to downplay the situation,</span><span class="s1"> Cecilia was deeply frightened. </span><span class="s2">He tried to intervene, presenting the pasta sauce and forcing Cecilia to acknowledge that she believed the sauce had been poisoned</span><span class="s1">. I</span><span class="s2">n response to his intervention, Ramirez recalled that the officer &ldquo;sort of did this half shrug. He laughed kind of, kind of did this thing like, &lsquo;What am I going to do with that?&rsquo; sort of gesture.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tov&rsquo;s report said Cecilia denied Young had tried to poison her. He said she didn&rsquo;t appear ill, so he didn&rsquo;t mention the allegation to his partner. Neither officer sought to interview Ramirez at length.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Victims often refuse to speak out against abusers once authorities intervene, domestic violence experts say. The Police Department&rsquo;s general order on domestic violence states that officers should not be influenced by a victim&rsquo;s &ldquo;initial reluctance regarding an officer-initiated arrest.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tov would later testify that he asked Lam if Young had abused her in the past. She mentioned the Valentine&rsquo;s Day incident in which he&rsquo;d been arrested, but said the couple had moved on from it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The officers did not run a background check on Young, which would have shown them not only that arrest but previous assault arrests, which experts said should have raised red flags about his potential for violence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Neither officer considered the visit a domestic violence call, citing the lack of injury and that Cecilia did not appear frightened. By </span><span class="s2">doing so</span><span class="s1">, they did not initiate several steps laid out in department policy. They did not offer Cecilia a victim referral card listing resources should she need them, nor did they inform her of her right to make a citizen&rsquo;s arrest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After about 15 minutes in the alley, the officers watched Young walk away from the building, then left themselves. Young would not be gone for long.</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Cecilia that family members and friends knew and loved was unafraid to speak up and unwilling to be disrespected or bullied. That&rsquo;s why the relationship she&rsquo;d continued with Young baffled so many of them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She hid the bad parts from her parents, reluctant to make them worry. But after the 2012 incident in which Young was arrested, she called her brother Eddie. And like she&rsquo;d done for them so many times before, her brothers came together to support her.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eddie told her, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always made the right decisions. I trust that you will make the right decision now.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;She always taught me, you never lay your hands on a woman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was just hoping that Ceci would see for herself. All the things she preached about what I should never do to a woman was something she experienced. But for some reason, her heart just didn&rsquo;t want to let that go.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Complicating matters, Young appeared to be using drugs and alcohol to mask untreated mental illness, said his aunt. About a month before the murder-suicide, he told her, &ldquo;Aunty, when I am in the house by myself, I hear voices.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another time, Young told his uncle he saw a figure in a window, making faces at him. A couple months before his death, he called his father to say he had had put a pistol in his mouth and was going to shoot himself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">His family never thought he was serious in these instances, but looking back, Wallace said she realized he had been quietly asking for help. Maybe he could have gotten that help, Wallace said, had the police heeded Cecilia&rsquo;s calls.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">&ldquo;This could have been stopped,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He could have been alive today. They both could have been alive today.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just 15 minutes after Officers Tov and Lobsinger left Natoma Street, Young returned, and Cecilia was back on the phone to 911. It was 10:01 p.m.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m having a domestic violence issue that is escalating,&rdquo; Cecilia said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dispatcher recognized the caller (HER VOICE?).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Your boyfriend&rsquo;s back?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Roommate Nikki McKay arrived home about 20 minutes before Young returned. Feeling bad for Young, McKay handed him some of his clothes in a garbage bag. But when she tried to talk to him through the front door, he attempted to force his way in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a panic, Ramirez grabbed a fire extinguisher as a weapon as McKay dead-bolted the door. Cecilia ran to the back patio to call 911 again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Is this Cecilia?&rdquo; asked the dispatcher who picked up at 10:09 p.m.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s actually in the cage now,&rdquo; she said in a frightened voice, referring to the area inside the iron security gate. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to open the front door.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dispatchers coded the call as both a domestic violence incident and an attempted break-in, and upgraded the urgency call from priority B to A &mdash; meaning it was a serious crime in progress. Officers Lobsinger and Tov returned a few minutes later, this time with Sgt. Steven Haskell.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tov interviewed Cecilia again. Afterward, Haskell said in his court deposition, T</span><span class="s2">ov told him that all they could arrest Young for was public intoxication</span><span class="s1">, a misdemeanor that results in a mere citation and four hours in the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;drunk tank,&rdquo; a jail holding cell. Tov didn&rsquo;t mention the poisoning allegations from earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;The victim wanted nothing done,&rdquo; Tov told Haskell.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">None of the officers interviewed Ramirez or McKay. If they had, McKay might have told them what she said later in her deposition &mdash; that she thought she&rsquo;d seen a gun in Young&rsquo;s waistband sometime before he was taken into custody. (</span><span class="s2">WAIT &mdash; HE WAS ARRESTED? CONFUSED HERE. The ordering of this is confusing)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&rsquo;s unclear where the murder weapon was at this point, but such an allegation could have changed the direction of the case, according to law enforcement and domestic violence experts said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The officers might have pursued charges against Young for the attempted break-in. They might have offered Cecilia domestic violence victim services, or advised her to spend the night elsewhere, or offered her an emergency protective order, which would have given them cause to arrest Young if he returned yet again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead, as Young left in the back of a patrol car, heading to the city&rsquo;s drunk tank, Cecilia and her roommates went back into the apartment.</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the first time since they had all lived together on Natoma Street, the five roommates sat down together.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ceci had been master tenant since about 2006, filling the rooms with an ever-changing roster of friends, acquaintances and Craigslist strangers. This latest set of roommates got along, but were rarely home at the same time. That night, they rallied around Cecilia, making each other drinks in the kitchen.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They took pictures of the pasta sauce for evidence. Ceci, ever the ham, posed next to a container of it, making a silly face.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;We had a real conversation with Ceci, telling her she had to respect herself better than this,&rdquo; McKay said. &ldquo;I was going to call out of work (the next day) and go with her to file a restraining order.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As her relationship with Young had devolved, so had the apartment. Cecilia was in charge of cleaning the shared spaces, but rarely did. The walls were yellow from her chain-smoking. After her death, the roommates would learn she had stopped paying the utility bills &mdash; an uncharacteristic act for someone who for much of her life had taken care of everyone else.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But that night, after a few drinks, the roommates talked about redecorating. They talked about the future. They went to bed hopeful.</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Protocol for public intoxication in San Francisco, and most </span><span class="s2">cities</span><span class="s1">, is to hold suspects and give them time to sober up</span><span class="s2">.</span><span class="s1"> Police drove Young from Natoma Street to nearby County Jail No. 1 at 850 Bryant St., run by San Francisco sheriff&rsquo;s deputies.</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lam&rsquo;s roommates said </span><span class="s2">they knew Young consumed a bottle</span><span class="s1"> of vodka that night (HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT?). While he was deemed sober enough to leave the drunk tank about four hours after he arrived, his autopsy report showed he died with a blood-alcohol content of .16 &mdash; double the legal limit for driving.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">When a suspect is booked into county jail, all the deputies at the jail know are the charges on which he was arrested. The deputies who processed Young would not have known he had been harassing an ex-girlfriend and trying to force his way into her home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Beverly Upton, head of the city&rsquo;s Domestic Violence Consortium, a network of service agencies coordinating to help domestic violence victims, said this may be a dangerous gap in communications. If deputies knew such details, Upton said, they could do more to keep the person in custody, or provide counseling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead, Young was released between 3 and 4 a.m. He was just three blocks from Cecilia&rsquo;s apartment.</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Young walked to the apartment and began calling and texting Lam. She called 911 at 4:03 a.m. and 4:08 a.m. Now, her voice was a whisper, her fear stark.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Our front lock gate is not very good,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can hear him actually trying to open it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moments later, she sounded like she was hyperventilating: &ldquo;Oh God, I saw the gate open. I saw the gate open! He&rsquo;s ringing the doorbell now, oh my God, oh my God. I told him not to come back.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dispatcher advised Lam to retreat into her bedroom and close the door.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With no Southern Station patrol officers available, two officers from nearby Tenderloin Station, David Lee and Viet Ha, arrived a few minutes later. Recognizing the address on the radio as the one he&rsquo;d responded to earlier that night, Sgt. Haskell from Southern Station steered to the scene as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lee and Ha, who had been texted by Lobsinger about the previous responses after Lobsinger heard the call over the radio, found Young outside. He told them he needed clothes for work the next day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While Young remained calm as they talked, Lee would later testify, Cecilia came down the stairs yelling and swearing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;See what I&rsquo;m dealing with?&rdquo; Young told the officers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though the officers had responded to a priority &ldquo;break-in,&rdquo; they determined it wasn&rsquo;t a break-in, as Young had previously lived in the apartment. Cecilia never used the words &ldquo;breaking in,&rdquo; Ha said, reporting only that Young had banged on the door.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The officers told Cecilia that Young needed to retrieve some belongings from inside. She consented, they said, so they assisted him in what is known as a civil standby.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to send an angry girlfriend into a house, go collect things for a guy, because they&rsquo;re probably not going to come back in one piece,&rdquo; Lee later explained.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Nobody knows for sure where Young got the .32-caliber Colt pistol he used that night, or if he could have retrieved it during the civil standby. He didn&rsquo;t have the gun when he entered jail a few hours earlier, and he didn&rsquo;t own a car.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Young was in the apartment for about 10 minutes. Officer Ha did not see exactly what he took from Cecilia&rsquo;s room, but Lee said he saw that he shook out a shirt and pants and stuffed them in a bag along with a pair of shoes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Haskell arrived while everyone was inside the apartment. The sergeant said he told Cecilia that &ldquo;if anything were to happen,&rdquo; she or the officers could obtain a restraining order.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She declined, Haskell said, and &ldquo;reassured me there was no domestic violence,&rdquo; though she&rsquo;d told the 911 dispatcher just minutes before that she was the victim of an &ldquo;escalating domestic violence issue&rdquo; </span><span class="s2">and was getting a restraining order.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The three officers and Young exited the apartment, and Cecilia locked the door behind them. </span><span class="s2">Officer </span><span class="s1">Lee had a pack of cigarettes hanging out of his pocket, and Young asked for one. The men chatted as they smoked together.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Young appeared as a pleasant person,&rdquo; Haskell said. &ldquo;He was, you know, cooperative. And I was talking to him, and we had a one-on-one conversation, not even related to work.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He said he told Young, &ldquo;Listen, this is the second time you&rsquo;re coming back here. If, you know, you might come back a third time, if you hit her or anything happens, you&rsquo;re going to jail.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;No, no. I understand,&rdquo; Young replied. &ldquo;I just wanted my stuff. I&rsquo;m done with her.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This sort of casual interaction is neither unusual nor inappropriate, law enforcement officers say. Officers need to defuse tensions. That way, if they need to make an arrest, the suspect is less likely to be combative.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Upton, of the Domestic Violence Consortium, said abusers are notorious for explaining away their behavior, connecting with police officers man-to-man and convincing them of the &ldquo;crazy ex-girlfriend trope.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;They may have thought they were de-escalating things,&rdquo; Upton said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think it makes the victim feel very safe when she looks outside and sees her abuser having a cigarette with the police officers that are supposed to protect her.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ha and Lee said they didn&rsquo;t run Young&rsquo;s criminal history before they responded. They knew only that he had been arrested for public intoxication. They knew nothing about the 2012 domestic violence arrest and the alleged poisoning, and little of Lam&rsquo;s repeated 911 calls.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In his deposition, Lee put the onus on Cecilia, saying she didn&rsquo;t tell officers about Young&rsquo;s actions that night.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;If she would have told me (about their history), he&rsquo;d have been in buckles,&rdquo; Lee said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of putting the handcuffs on anybody.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shortly after 4:30 a.m., Young left. The officers said they told him not to come back, and he said he wasn&rsquo;t planning to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Within half an hour,</span><span class="s1"> he was kicking down the front door, gun in hand.</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The commotion was so great as Young rushed up the stairs from the front door to Cecilia&rsquo;s bedroom door, and as he kicked it open as if it were made of cardboard, that roommate Timothy Cochran locked his door, shut himself in his closet and called police.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;My roommate&rsquo;s boyfriend,&rdquo; he babbled </span><span class="s2">in a terrified whisper.</span><span class="s1"> &ldquo;He&rsquo;s killing her.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Misael Fuentes, the fourth roommate, also called 911.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;We need the cops right now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My roommate Ceci has been calling about her boyfriend. He tried to poison her today.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Cecilia&rsquo;s been calling all night,&rdquo; the dispatcher responded. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on now?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By then, Cecilia&rsquo;s own final emergency call had gone silent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Hello? Hello?&rdquo; said the dispatcher.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only sound that came over the line was Cecilia&rsquo;s labored breathing. She gurgled as if she were trying to say something, </span><span class="s2">but couldn&rsquo;t get the words out.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Help is already on the way,&rdquo; the dispatcher said. &ldquo;Stay on the line.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Officers who entered the dark apartment about six minutes later found Cecilia still alive, moaning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Holy shit,&rdquo; one said. (HOW DO WE KNOW?)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A hysterical McKay tried to leave her bedroom, but the officers told her to stay inside. At some point, Officer Tov appeared at her door. It was his third time at the apartment that night.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us he was dangerous?&rdquo; Tov asked, according to McKay.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Three years later, her voice still shakes with anger when she recalls the conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;We did tell you,&rdquo; she (SAID?) told the officer. &ldquo;You were called. You were called several times that night to take him away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(WONDERING WHY THERE IS NO TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE THIS ALL CLEARER TO RESPONDING COPS? DONT THEY GET A LIST OF CALLS MADE TO AN ADDRESS WHEN RESPONDING? wHY DID 911 DISPATCHERS WHO RECOGNIZED HER NOT TEL THEM?</span></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No internal investigation took place following Cecilia&rsquo;s death, despite a complaint her family filed with the Department for Police Accountability, <strong>which is XXX</strong>. (WHY NOT?)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The officers who responded to her 911 calls that night&mdash; Tov, Lobsinger, Haskell, Lee and Ha &mdash; are still with the city force.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Capt. Bailey of the department&rsquo;s special victims unit said the city has made significant progress in its handling of domestic violence calls since the stabbing of Tempongko in 2000. City agencies, nonprofits and victim advocates collaborate now in developing policy, finding funding and providing resources for victims.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Included in those reforms is a revised department general order on domestic violence. A comprehensive policy, it addresses the many complexities of domestic violence cases, said Nick Casper, an attorney representing Cecilia&rsquo;s family.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It requires responding officers to look beyond a victim&rsquo;s reluctance to cooperate and instructs them to consider the victim&rsquo;s history of complaints. It defines domestic violence as a crime beyond a visible injury.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The policy went into effect two days before Cecilia died.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The officers who responded would have been aware of it, Casper said. But having such a policy means nothing when officers refuse to view a call as domestic violence, as those involved in the Lam case admitted to in their court depositions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;I think dispatch did everything they could,&rdquo; Casper said. &ldquo;They took down what Cecilia was telling them, they coded it appropriately. Cecilia in her calls even used the &lsquo;magic language,&rsquo; calling it an &lsquo;escalating domestic violence situation.&rsquo; But when the officers were presented with this situation that did not have the most overt signs of domestic violence, their response seemed to be, &lsquo;How do I get out of here and take the next call?&rsquo; rather than, &lsquo;How can I help this citizen who felt she was in enough danger to call 911?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2015, a police crime lab analyzed the the pasta sauce that Cecilia believed Young had poisoned. The sauce, which was finally taken into evidence after the murder-suicide, tested positive for rat poison.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s2">Lam</span><span class="s1"> family sued the city in federal court in 2015, </span><span class="s2">seeking damages and </span><span class="s1">hoping to force the Police Department to re-evaluate how its officers respond to domestic violence. </span><span class="s2">This past June</span><span class="s1">, Magistrate Judge Kandis Westmore dismissed the case. </span><span class="s2">Public entities are protected from liability regarding injury or death caused by purported failure to protect, and the allegation that the officers created more danger by allowing Young into the apartment and possibly accessing the firearm lacked evidence, Westmore wrote in her decision.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The family decided not to appeal the ruling. But the dismissal in civil court does not absolve the city, Casper said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&ldquo;Whether something is legally actionable and whether it is morally wrong are unfortunately two different questions,&rdquo; Casper said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SUGGEST CUTTING THE REST OF THIS:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><strong>I</strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>nvestigators from other agencies said officers who respond to reports of domestic violence must be thorough. They need to talk to witnesses, look into the couple&rsquo;s history and past interactions with authorities, and try to connect the victim with services &mdash; actions that for the most </strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>part </strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>did not happen before Cecilia&rsquo;s death.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Upton, of the Domestic Violence Consortium, said law enforcement agencies nationwide, including in San Francisco, have come a long way in their view of domestic violence. But it&rsquo;s not enough, she said.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>It remains one of the few crimes in which the reaction is often to first question the seemingly self-destructive choices of the victim, Upton said. She said police should be asking better questions: What did he do to her to make it so hard for her to get help? What are the circumstances making her feel that she can&rsquo;t leave?</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><strong>Cecilia Lam&rsquo;s death demonstrates just how complicated and frustrating domestic violence really is, Upton said. Cecilia Lam called for help. She called for help eight times. And still she was murdered.</strong></span></p>
